ReloadCSS
==================================================

What is it?
--------------------------------------

It's a silly little bookmarklet to save time.  As websites become more complicated testing CSS is becoming a giant pain.
It used to be you just reload the page and you'd see your changes.  Now you often have to click through an entire application
written in JavaScript unless you're code is advanced enough to update the url (it should hopefully).  

This bookmarklet tries to get the external css to reload so that you can view your changes without hitting reload and loosing
the state of your application.
